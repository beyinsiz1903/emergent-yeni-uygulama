# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🎯 COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND UI TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE - AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM NOT WORKING:
      - Frontend loads correctly with RoomOps branding and professional UI
      - Registration form displays properly with all required fields (Property Name, Admin Name, Email, Phone, Address, Password)
      - Login form displays correctly with Email and Password fields
      - However, authentication process fails - users cannot successfully register or login
      - After form submission, users remain on auth page instead of being redirected to dashboard
      - This blocks access to ALL application features and modules
      
      🔍 TECHNICAL FINDINGS:
      - Frontend URL working: https://react-devtools.preview.emergentagent.com
      - Auth page renders correctly with proper form fields and styling
      - Backend error detected: ValueError in daily flash report endpoint (Invalid isoformat string: 'invalid-date')
      - Frontend shows no visible error messages to users
      - Form submissions appear to process but don't result in successful authentication
      
      📋 MODULES UNABLE TO TEST DUE TO AUTH BLOCK:
      - Dashboard (cannot access)
      - PMS Module with all tabs (Front Desk, Housekeeping, Rooms, Guests, Bookings, Reports)
      - Invoice Module with advanced tax features
      - RMS Module with pricing suggestions
      - Folio Management system
      - Check-in/Check-out processes
      - Housekeeping Board
      - Company Management
      - All reporting features
      
      🚨 IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
      - Application is completely unusable for end users
      - No hotel operations can be performed
      - All backend functionality is inaccessible through the UI
      - This is a BLOCKING issue that prevents any real-world usage
      
      ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
      - Fix authentication system to allow user registration and login
      - Investigate backend date parsing error in daily flash report
      - Verify API connectivity between frontend and backend
      - Test complete authentication flow after fixes
